# Tic Tac Toe

**Play the game:** [https://devansh-awat.github.io/games/TicTacToe/](https://devansh-awat.github.io/games/TicTacToe/)

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game initially developed in Python and then ported to HTML using Gemini for web deployment.  The Python version, included below, served as the foundation for the web-based version.  Due to my limited web development experience at the time, Gemini provided an accessible way to bring the game online.

## Features

* **Playable in Browser:** Enjoy the game directly in your web browser.
* **Bot Opponent:** Play against a simple AI opponent.

## Future Improvements

* **Enhanced UI:** The current UI is functional but basic. A more visually appealing design would enhance the user experience.
* **Player Start Option:** Currently, the bot always makes the first move. Adding an option for the player to choose who starts would be a good addition.
